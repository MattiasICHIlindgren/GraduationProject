Graduation Project

This is my graduation project that i've been working on while i've studied as a software developer IoT. 
The project can be seen as a program for a small smart watch module that display three different components , Time , Wather and a small stopwatch. 
I've added som backround to the components to make it look visaully better. 
I was inspired by youtuber VolosProject https://www.youtube.com/@VolosProjects to make this ESP32 TTGO SmartWatch
